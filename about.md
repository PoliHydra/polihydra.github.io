# {{ page.title }}

PoliHydra was created at [**POLI**tecnico di
Milano][polimi] by a small group of researchers to
develop numerical tools for the simulation of **HYDR**ogen
embrittlement with **A**baqus FEA, hence the rather silly
“<u>Poli</u>&nbsp;<u>Hydr</u>&nbsp;<u>a</u>” name.

The project grew out from our desire to make published research
finding fully replicable. However numerical simulations in this field
require quite a complicated setup and extensive use of Abaqus *user
subroutines*, and the simple publication of code snippets and input
files is not sufficient to this purpose. Computer code is not
something static, but evolves over time: we decided to go open source
and make our development history available trough a public version control
system (VCS).

The VCS of choice was [git](https://git-scm.com/doc) and currently
[GitHub](https://github.com) is the project public hosting
service. All public code and the source of this website can be found
under the GitHub [PoliHydra
organization](https://github.com/PoliHydra).  This site is currently
hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
